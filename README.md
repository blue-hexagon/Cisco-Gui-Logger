# Cisco GUI Logger [WIP]
A desktop app that lets you collect information about multiple Cisco devices simultaneously and displays them on a webpage for quick back-and-forth comparison of configurations.

SSH connections are programmed to run sequentially and inject various commands. An output is returned and saved in text files and after all connections have finished Jinja2 is used to render the textfiles into interlinked webpages.
